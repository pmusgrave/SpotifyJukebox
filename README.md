# Spotify Jukebox

### Synchronize playback between multiple Spotify accounts!

Multiple users can search and add songs to a shared group playlist. The songs will play back on everyone's account in the party.

Alternatively, you can choose not to play back on any of your devices and still be able to add songs to the group playlist (e.g. if you're in the same physical location and the playlist is on one speaker).
